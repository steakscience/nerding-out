In this episode, I talk to Chloe Yeo. She is an amazing designer and also a climate activist. We talk about the urgency of the climate crisis and the Sunrise Movement, which is an organization that is trying to build people power to fight for real climate action.

We also talk about design school, the role that design can play in activism, and cute dogs.

Recorded on May 24th, 2020.
